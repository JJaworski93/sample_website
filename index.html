<h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

 <p>
   <strong><em>Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</em></strong> is a leader in the movement to teach
   technical sophistication, the seemingly magical ability to take
   command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
   everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
   Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
   We believe there are at least a billion people who can benefit from
   learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our

 <h2>Quotations</h2>
  <p>
   In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the
   Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:
  </p>
  <p>
   <blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px; background: #fafafa;"> <p>
   <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em> <br>
       --Abraham Lincoln
  </p>

    William Shakespeare's <em>Sonnets</em> consists of 154 poems, each fourteen
    lines long (three
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrain">quatrains</a>
    followed by a rhyming
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet">couplet</a>).
    <strong>Sonnet 18</strong> is perhaps the most famous, and begins like this:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
      Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br>
      Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
      And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
